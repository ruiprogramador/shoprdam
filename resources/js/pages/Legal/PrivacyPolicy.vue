        <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Tabler, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level
            for no apparent reason.)
          </li>
          <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
          <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.</li>
          <li>
            We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, or permanently
            deleted.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This privacy policy explains how we collect, use and disclose information about you when you...</p>

          Non-Personally-Identifying Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          Like most website operators, Tabler collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,
          such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Tabler’s purpose in collecting
          non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Tabler’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Tabler may release
          non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
        </p>

          Personally-Identifying Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          A certain amount of visitors to Tabler choose to interact with Tabler in ways that require Tabler to gather personally-identifying information. The
          amount and type of information that Tabler gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with Tabler are asked to
          provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case,
          Tabler collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Tabler. Tabler
          does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
        </p>

          Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          Tabler discloses personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know
          that information in order to process it on Tabler’s behalf or to provide services available at Tabler’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to
          disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
          Tabler’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Tabler will not rent or sell personally-identifying information to anyone.
          Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Tabler discloses personally-identifying information only in
          response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Tabler believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
          protect the property or rights of Tabler, third parties, or the public at large.
